## Configuration Item Descriptions

### 1. **friday-plugin**
- **Description**: Indicates the enabled status of the MDFriday plugin.
- **Default value**: `enabled`
- **Explanation**: Keep this set to `enabled`, no need to modify. This field indicates the plugin's status and ensures the plugin works properly.

### 2. **site**
- **Description**: Site ID.
- **Default value**: `'1'` (automatically generated by the plugin)
- **Explanation**: This field is automatically generated by the MDFriday plugin and represents your site ID. It is recommended not to change this value.

### 3. **theme**
- **Description**: GitHub address of the theme.
- **Default value**: `github.com/mdfriday/theme-manual-of-me`
- **Explanation**: This field specifies the GitHub address of the Hugo theme to use. You can change it to the address of another theme if needed. If you are using the default Manual of Me theme, leave it unchanged.

### 4. **content**
- **Description**: Path to the content folder.
- **Default value**: `MDFriday/theme-manual-of-me/content`
- **Explanation**: This field defines the location of the theme’s content folder. Initially, the `content` field value is `empty`. The plugin will automatically update it to a relative path once the sample files are downloaded.

### 5. **Author**
- **Description**: Name or nickname of the site author.
- **Required**: **Yes**
- **Explanation**: **This is a required field.** You must fill in your name or nickname so that it will be displayed as the author information on the generated site. If left empty, some content may not display correctly.

## Required Fields Explanation

### **Author**
- **Required**: You must fill in your name or nickname in the `Author` field. This information is necessary for the theme to display the author correctly.
- **Default value**: There is no default value; the user must provide it.

> ⚠️ **Note**: If the `Author` field is left empty, the theme may not display the author information properly.

## Usage Suggestions
- If you wish to use a different Hugo theme, simply change the `theme` field to the new theme's GitHub address.
- The content directory `content` will be automatically updated after downloading the sample files, so there is no need to change it manually. However, if you want to point to a different file location, remember to update the path accordingly.
